"""
This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:

    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
    b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. 
"""

from random import randint

a = [randint(1,100) for x in range(10)]
b = [randint(1,100) for x in range(20)]

common_elements = set(a) & set(b)

print(a)
print(b)
print(common_elements)
